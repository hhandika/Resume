    <h3>Welcome | Selamat Datang</h3>
    <p>This is me committing to build my website from scratch.
    <p>Unfortunately, my web-programming skill is a bit rusty.</p>
    <p>It will take a while for me to finish this website. </p>
    <p>If you are still curious about me for some reasons,</p>
    <p>you could check my Google Scholar profile <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jaub_M0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I only have a few papers, though.</p>
    <p>I am still learning to publish.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy photography, please take a look at my photo gallery: <a target="_blank" href="http://portfolio.hhandika.com/">portfolio.hhandika.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I tweet random stuff from PhD's life, science, to computers,</p>
    <p>and I try to stay away from politics.</p>
    <p>If you speak Bahasa Indonesia, you could also check my blog <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tikus.net/">Tikus.Net</a>.</p>
    <p>I wrote about computers, fellowship, and study abroad.</p>
    <p>I am also in the process writing tutorials on phylogenetics, R statistics, and QGIS mapping for the blog.</p>
    <p>Yes. I am all over the place. &#128513;</p>
    <p>If those do not sound interesting to you. It's okay.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading to this point.</p>
