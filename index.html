  <h1>Heru Handika, An evolutionary biologist</h1>
  <h2>Website is under construction</h2>
  <h3>
    Welcome, my friend! Do not tell anyone yet!
  </h3>
  <p>This is me committing to build my website from scratch.
    Unfortunately, my web programming skill is a bit rusty.
    <p>I learned when it
    was still HTML3. Now, I am just starting my HTML5 journey.</p>
    <p>It will take a while for
    me to finish this website. </p>
    <p>If you are still curious about me for some reasons,</p>
    <p>you could go check my photography portfolio <a target="_blank" href="https://heruhandika.com/">heruhandika.com.</a></p>
    <p>Many people like my photos. You may like them too</p>
    <p>or follow me on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MammalsHeru">MammalsHeru</a></p>
    <p>I post random stuff from PhD's life, science, to computers</p>
