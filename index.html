  <meta name="description" content="I am a PhD student at the Museum of Natural Science
  and the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, USA. My research focus on
  documenting species diversity, understanding patterns of species distribution
  across space and time, and species adaptation to novel environment. I mainly work in Southeast Asia.">

    <h1>Heru Handika</h1>
    <p>I travel across islands and mountains in Southeast Asia to find answers for
      these questions: what is a species? how did past geological events shape biodiversity we know today?
      How do species adapt to extreme environment?</p>
      <p>My work combines rigorous fieldwork to remote places, artwork through phytography and graphic design,
      and computer work using available scientific tools, so that we have improved knowledge on species diversity.
      Currently, I am a PhD student in <a target="_blank" href="https://esselstyn.github.io/">Esselstyn's Lab</a> at
      the Museum of Natural Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, USA.</p>

    <p>This is me committing to build my website from scratch.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, my web-programming skill is a bit rusty.</p>
    <p>It will take a while for me to finish this website.</p>
    <p>If you are still curious about me for some reasons,
    you could check my Google Scholar profile <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jaub_M0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">here</a>.
    If you enjoy photography, please take a look at my photo gallery: <a target="_blank" href="http://portfolio.hhandika.com/">portfolio.hhandika.com</a>.
    Many people like my photos. You may like them too. &#128526;
    Or follow me on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MammalsHeru">MammalsHeru</a>.
    I tweet random stuff from PhD's life, science, to computers,
    and I try to stay away from politics.
    If you speak Bahasa Indonesia, you could also check my blog <a href="https://www.tikus.net/">Tikus.Net</a>.
    I wrote about computers, fellowship, and study abroad.
    I am also in the process writing tutorials for the blog on phylogenetics, R statistics, and QGIS mapping.</p>
    <p>Yes. I am all over the place. &#128513;</p>
