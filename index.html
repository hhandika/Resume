    <h1>Heru Handika, an evolutionary biologist</h1>
    <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://esselstyn.github.io/">Esselstyn's Lab</a> at Louisiana State University, USA.</p>
    <p>I am interested on understanding species diversity, distribution, and evolutionary processes</p>

      Welcome, visitors!
    </h3>
    <p>This is me committing to build my website from scratch.
    <p>Unfortunately, my web-programming skill is a bit rusty.</p>
    <p>I learned it when it was still HTML3.</p>
    <p>Now, I am just starting my HTML5 journey.</p>
    <p>It will take a while for me to finish this website. </p>
    <p>If you are still curious about me for some reasons,</p>
    <p>you could go check my photography portfolio <a target="_blank" href="http://portfolio.hhandika.com/">portfolio.hhandika.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Many people like my photos. You may like them too. &#128526; </p>
    <p>Or follow me on twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MammalsHeru">MammalsHeru</a>.</p>
    <p>I tweet random stuff from PhD's life, science, to computers,</p>
    <p>and I try to stay away from politics.</p>
    <p>If you speak Bahasa Indonesia, you could also check my blog <a href="https://www.tikus.net/">Tikus.Net</a>.</p>
    <p>I wrote about computers, fellowship, and study abroad.</p>
    <p>I am also in the process writing tutorials for the blog on phylogenetics, R statistics, and QGIS mapping.</p>
    <p>Yes. I am all over the place. &#128513;</p>
